-------

This library contains common validators that may be used in Orchejs projects. It doesn't mean that you cannot use it in other type of projects, by the way, it would be a good practice to use the same backend validators in frontend or mobile projects. For example, to use a validator in an Angular project, it would be necessary to create a directive calling one of the validators of @orche/validators.

This project is divided in two kinds of validators: Global and Local. The first one comprises common validators, which means, anything that are not from a specific country or region. Examples of global validators are email, not null and length checkers. Local validators are anything that belongs to a specific country like zip code, documents as ID cards and so on.

The idea here is to make a public repository that may grow with the community contribution. So if you need a validator that does not exists here, please open a PR and help us to improve it. For contributions, please check the [contributions]() topic.
