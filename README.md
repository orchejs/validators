Orche Validators
==================

Library exposing common validators known as globals. There are also custom validators that deal with local validation, divided in a locale structure, for example: en_US, pt_BR and so on.

The idea here is to make a public repository that may grow with the community contribution. So if you need a validator that does not exists here, please open a PR and help us to improve it, because we will be helping a lot of developers.
